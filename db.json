Abby changes her mind when Maxine reminds her of a casual acquaintance, widowed chemical engineer Jake Iverson, who she has not seen or thought about in six or seven years from before her husband's death. Based on some unfortunate situations and some misunderstandings, Abby and Jake's new-found relationship does not start off well.
